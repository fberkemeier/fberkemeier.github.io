Our new preprint is out! ðŸŽ‰

We show how the complex 3D shapes of epithelial cells in the _Drosophila_ wing can expand their network of neighbours to fine-tune Notchâ€“Delta signalling and achieve precise cell patterning. Using a new mathematical framework, the Multi-layer Signalling Model, we link real 3D cell topologies to signalling range, and confirm predictions with in vivo experiments.
