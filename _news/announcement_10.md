I am delighted to share that I have been appointed College Research Associate at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge.

I am very grateful to the College for this recognition and for the opportunity to be part of its academic community. It is a privilege to be associated with Emmanuel and to engage more closely with colleagues across disciplines.

I look forward to contributing to College life in the months ahead.
