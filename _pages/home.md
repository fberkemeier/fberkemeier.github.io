Welcome to my page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge in the [Boemo Group](https://www.boemogroup.org), where I study DNA replication kinetics, focusing on how origin firing and fork dynamics maintain genome stability in cancer cells.

Previously, I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at University College London, where I developed mathematical models of cell signalling and pattern formation in _Drosophila_ tissues, while also investigating broader questions in evolutionary dynamics.

My general interests include mathematical biology and computational genetics, specifically in modelling cellular processes, pattern formation, tumour dynamics, stochastic processes, physics-informed machine learning, functional analysis, and game theory.
