Our latest research, _[DNA replication timing reveals genome-wide features of transcription and fragility](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.25.625090v1)_, is now on bioRxiv!

We present a 1-kilobase resolution mathematical model linking replication timing to genome-wide patterns in human cells. The study uncovers how genomic architecture, chromatin organisation, and transcription influence replication dynamics, shedding light on replication stress and genome stability.
