Welcome to my page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge in the [Boemo Group](https://www.boemogroup.org), where I study DNA replication kinetics, focusing on how origin firing and fork dynamics maintain genome stability in cancer cells.

I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at University College London, where I developed mathematical models of cell signalling and pattern formation in Drosophila tissues and explored evolutionary dynamics.

My interests span mathematical biology and computational genetics, particularly in modelling cellular processes and applying physics-informed machine learning to therapeutic contexts. I'm also fascinated by genetics, pattern formation, tumour dynamics, stochastic processes, machine learning, and game theory.
