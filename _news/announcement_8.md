Last week’s Research in Genetics departmental symposium was a welcome opportunity to step back from day to day work and see the breadth of research happening across the department. I was very grateful to learn that my poster was awarded the [Best Postdoc Poster prize at this year's meeting](https://www.boemogroup.org/post/francisco-wins-award-for-best-poster-at-departmental-symposium).

The poster focused on ongoing work on the theory and mathematical modelling of whole genome DNA replication in human cells. It brought together recently [published results in Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59991-w) with newer directions that aim to push these models further, both conceptually and in terms of how they connect to experimental data.

I was honoured to receive the award from [Frank Jiggins](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/directory/frank-jiggins), Deputy Head of Department for Research, and thankful to the organisers and judges for their time and care. More broadly, I am grateful to be part of a department that values clear communication across disciplines and creates space for early career researchers to share work in progress.

Many thanks to everyone who stopped by the poster and to colleagues whose feedback continues to shape this project.
