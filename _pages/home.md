Welcome to my page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge and a member of the [Boemo Group](https://www.boemogroup.org). My research focuses on understanding DNA replication kinetics by examining key factors like origin firing and fork dynamics to reveal how these elements together influence replication stability across human cancer cell genomes. Through the creation and refinement of stochastic models, I aim to elucidate how cellular stress, especially from chemotherapeutic agents, affects genome replication and determines cell fate.

I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at University College London, where I worked on mathematical models of cell-cell signalling and pattern formation within epithelial tissues of _Drosophila melanogaster_, as well as on evolutionary dynamics models to study symmetry in interacting populations. Both topics continue to be integral to my current research.

My academic interests lie in mathematical biology and computational genetics, with a focus on modelling complex cellular processes. I am also keen on exploring the potential of physics-informed machine learning for therapeutic applications. More broadly, I am interested in genetics, pattern formation, tumour dynamics, stochastic processes, machine learning, functional analysis, and game theory.
