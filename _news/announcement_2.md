I recently delivered a research pitch on modeling DNA replication at LUSO 2024, the annual conference organized by the Portuguese Association of Researchers and Students in the UK ([PARSUK](https://www.parsuk.pt)). It was a great opportunity to connect with fellow Portuguese researchers and share insights on advancing our understanding in this area.
