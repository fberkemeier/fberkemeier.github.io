Excited to share that our latest paper has been published in _[Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/)_! ðŸ§¬

_["DNA replication timing reveals genome-wide features of transcription and fragility"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59991-w)_

In this work, we present a high-resolution mathematical model that captures the intricate relationship between DNA replication timing, origin firing, transcription, and chromatin organisation. Leveraging Repli-seq data across multiple human cell lines, our model reveals how regions of model-data divergence often coincide with fragile sites and long genes, while regions of strong concordance are linked to open chromatin and active promoters. More than just mapping these dynamics, our approach provides a precise and efficient tool for researchers to uncover regions susceptible to replication stress, a hallmark of cancer.

A big thank you to my co-authors Michael Boemo (University of Cambridge) and Peter R. Cook (University of Oxford), the Boemo lab, all collaborators, and everyone who supported this research.
