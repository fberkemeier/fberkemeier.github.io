Welcome to my page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge and a member of the [Boemo Group](https://www.boemogroup.org). My main research centres on understanding DNA replication kinetics, driven by key features such as origin firing and fork dynamics, to reveal how these processes collectively impact replication stability across the genomes of human cancer cells. By developing and refining stochastic models, I seek to uncover how cellular stress, particularly from chemotherapeutic agents, influences genome replication and shapes cell fate.

Previously, I completed my PhD in applied mathematics at University College London, where I developed mathematical models of cell-cell signalling and pattern formation within epithelial tissues of _Drosophila melanogaster_, as well as models of evolutionary dynamics to study symmetry in interacting populations. Both areas remain central to my ongoing research.

I am deeply interested in mathematical biology and computational genetics, particularly in modelling complex cellular processes. I am also drawn to the potential of physics-informed machine learning in genomic research and therapeutic applications. My broader interests include genetics, pattern formation, tumour dynamics, stochastic processes, machine learning, functional analysis, and game theory.
