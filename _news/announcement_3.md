I recently presented a poster titled "Whole-genome mathematical model of DNA Replication in human cells" at the UK DNA Replication Meeting 2024, organised by the [Biochemical Society](https://www.biochemistry.org), held at Churchill College, Cambridge.

The research presented here in now available as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.25.625090v1).
