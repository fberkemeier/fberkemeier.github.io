Ecstatic to share that our latest paper has been published in _PLOS Computational Biology_! ðŸ§¬

["Regulation of replication timing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae"](journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013066)

We present a simple model that explains how yeast cells control the timing of DNA replication. We show that competition among replication origins for a limited pool of essential proteins can reproduce key experimental features of replication dynamics. The model also predicts how changes in protein availability affect replication timing. This work provides a new tool to study DNA replication and its regulation.

A big thank you to my co-authors Rosie Berners-Lee, Eamonn Gilmore, Michael Boemo, and everyone who supported this research.
